# Face Recognition using Python

This project demonstrates face recognition using Python and popular libraries like OpenCV, face_recognition. It provides a foundation for building applications that can identify individuals from images or video streams.

## Features

*   **Image-based Face Recognition:** Identifies faces in static images and compares them against a database of known faces.
*   **Real-time Face Recognition:**  Performs face recognition on video streams from a webcam or other video source.
*   **Face Detection:** Detects the presence of faces in images or video frames, even if they are partially obscured or at different angles.
*   **Face Encoding:** Generates unique numerical representations of faces, which are used for comparison.
*   **Comparison and Matching:** Compares the encodings of detected faces with known encodings to identify individuals.
*   **Accuracy Evaluation:** Include if you have any evaluation metrics.
*   **Clear and Concise Code:**  Well-documented and easy-to-understand code for educational purposes.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **OpenCV (cv2):** For image and video processing, face detection, and drawing bounding boxes.
*   **face\_recognition:**  A high-level library built on top of dlib, simplifying face detection and recognition tasks. (Or mention dlib directly if used).
*   **(Mention any other libraries used, e.g., dlib, mediapipe, scikit-learn):**  For specific functionalities like face landmark detection, model training, etc.
*   **(Optional: Mention any specific hardware requirements, e.g., webcam):** If the project uses any specific hardware.

## Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python face_recognition  # Or mention dlib if used directly
# Install other required libraries

(Provide more specific installation instructions if needed, especially for libraries that might require additional steps.)

Future Enhancements (Optional)

    Improved Accuracy: Explore different face recognition models or techniques to enhance accuracy.
    Liveness Detection: Implement methods to prevent spoofing attacks (e.g., using photos or videos).
    Integration with Web/Mobile Apps: Develop a user interface for easier interaction.
    Real-time Performance Optimization: Optimize the code for faster processing of video streams.
    Training on Custom Datasets: Allow users to train the model on their own datasets.
